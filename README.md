# Exploring-Chinook-Database
* In this Project, I queried the Chinook Database which holds information about a Music store. the aim of this project is to assist the Chinook team to understand the media in their store,their customers and employees, and their invoice Information.
* I created four unique SQL queries that included **JOINS** and **Aggregations** (count and sum).
* I also created visualizations for the result of each **SQL** query.
* After my analysis, I was able to answer four questions; Who is the best Employee?, Which Customer spent the least?, What is the highest purchased Genre? and Which Genre of Music has the highest number of Customers?.
